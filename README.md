# Project3

## Initial Speculation
Vampire survivors
	*BUT*
		To defend yourself from the "enemies" you build walls n shit
		The enemies interact with your  lines in different ways
			Some slide off them
			Some break them (maybe like once then die on the next one)
			Some you can kill by drawing a line through them
				!!SLICE!!
		Upgrades
			Bigger lines
			Maybe you have "line juice" - so you can only make SO MANY lines
			Maybe movement options
				Teleport around my line
				Slide on my line
	Its kind of like fruit ninja meet bloons
